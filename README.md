  <p align="center">
    Amazon Jobs Alertbot is a simple AWS-powered job alert agent that scrapes amazon.jobs with your search criteria and emails you updates... because Amazon apparently doesn't want you to be able to get updates the easy way.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Amazon Job Alertbot

Amazon Job Alertbot was born over a weekend (probably more like 6 hours collectively...) out of a simple frustration -- unlike *every other jobs site on earth* -- Amazon jobs doesn't allow you to set up an update agent. It's clearly a deliberate choice, for reasons I can't discern.

Because I enjoy irony, I designed Amazon Jobs Alertbot for easy deployment as an AWS Lambda function, and otherwise use AWS services: DynamoDB to store jobs, Systems Manager's ParamStore to store configurations, CloudWatch Events to trigger the function at a time of your choosing, and Simple Email Service to send you emails with new jobs matching your criteria, and of course CloudWatch for logging. Just in case someone at Amazon thought adding jobs alerts would be too hard; I wanted to make it easy for them if they changed their mind.

Of course, you can also easily modify the script to run locally, or on an instance of your choice.

Until I find some spare time to provide more detailed instructions, this guide assumes you have at least a rudimentary familiarization with these AWS services and IAM for identity/access management.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The script is ready to deploy as a Lambda function. To get it running, you need to:

### On Your Computer:

- Clone the repo
- Complete the [config/config.toml](/config/config.toml) to match your desired search criteria and settings. **NOTE: All fields are required even if left blank**
- Configure AWS CLI for access (`aws configure`) if you haven't already.
- run `python config/toml_to_ssm_paramstore.py` to automagically add your config parameters to your paramstore. **Your AWS role must have ssm:PutParameter permissions in IAM**

### On Your AWS Account:

- Set up Simple Email Service if you don't already have it configured
- Create a DynamoDB table for your job alert agent
- [Add the IAM policy](/config/sample_policy.json) and create a new role for your IAM function. You need to replace the placeholders with your function's name, DynamoDB table name, your AWS id, and your region.
- Create the Lambda function using [amazon_job_alertbot/main.py](/amazon_job_alertbot/main.py) and assign your lambda policy/role to the function. I suggest code signing it, which means you need to have or set up a profile in AWS Signer, zip main.py (I provide a zip package for you), and sign the zip with a signing job.
- Add a CloudWatch Events trigger to schedule the Lambda function when you want it to run. You don't need to pass anything in the JSON payload.
- Profit

**The IAM policy ready to copy:**
